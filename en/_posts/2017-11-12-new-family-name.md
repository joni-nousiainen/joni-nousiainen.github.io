title: My new family name is Nousjärvi
---

I and my significant other got married in June 2016. Neither of us wanted to adopt the other one's family name, so,
we decided to invent a brand new one. It took us some time to come up with our new name and then go through the
required bureaucracy but now it's official. The new name is combination of our previous names – Nousiainen and Järvinen.
