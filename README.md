## Developer notes

* Setup Jekyll following GitHub instructions: https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/
  * To install Jekyll on Windows 7 follow these instructions: http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/
  * At the time of writing this I used following install packages: `rubyinstaller-2.2.3-x64.exe` and `DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2-20130224-1432-sfx.exe`.
  * On Windows 10 if you have Ubuntu sub-system installed you can install Ruby with `apt-get install ruby ruby-dev make gcc zlib1g-dev`.
